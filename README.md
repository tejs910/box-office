 Live URL : https://tejs910.github.io/box-office/#/
 
 Here i have used api.tvmaze.com/ API to display results. Also storing data in localStorage.
 
 Project made by me, But the idea was from Internshala Training. They also provided solution but i have just used their design. They used stled-component so i used that too. But i love Css module and using it on my all projects.
